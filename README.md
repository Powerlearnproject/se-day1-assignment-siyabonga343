#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a division of computer science used for developing, ensuring workability of software and keeping it in a state of full functionality.
reliability- it makes sure the software does tasks appropriately,and in a manner corresponding to it's program without taking sides or being bias. 
efficiency - it aids to maintain a smooth and seamless workflow of the developer while maintaining high quality standards.
scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle traffic without crashing or being retarded.
security - implement safe and secure environment for user information by practicing authorization, authentication and encryption methods to protect/safeguard the user's information  . 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

mastering complexity-As software systems became larger and more complex, early developers faced a "software crisis"—programs were difficult to maintain, debug, and scale.
Mastering process-As teams grew and projects became more demanding, there was a need for structured development processes to ensure efficiency, quality, and predictability.
Mastering machine-With advancements in computing power, automation, and AI, software engineering has increasingly leveraged tools and frameworks to improve efficiency.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Planning – Figuring out what the software needs to do and how big the project will be.
2.Requirement Analysis – Understanding exactly what the users need from the software.
3.Design – Creating a blueprint or structure for how the software will work.
4.Coding – Writing the actual program using a programming language to bring the design to life.
5.Testing – Checking the software to find and fix any errors or problems before it is used.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall follows a step-by-step process, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. This means that planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment happen in a fixed order, and changes are difficult to make once a phase is completed. In contrast, Agile is flexible and iterative, meaning development happens in small cycles where changes and improvements can be made throughout the process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
A software developer is responsible for creating computer programs, applications, and systems using different coding languages and tools. They also update and maintain software to ensure it continues working properly.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A QA Engineer works with clients and developers to understand what the software should do. They set rules and guidelines for programmers to follow during development. Before the software is released, they test it to make sure it meets the requirements and works correctly.
Project Manager
The project manager brings together and leads the software development team. They discuss the project’s goals and requirements with clients and developers to ensure everyone understands what needs to be done. The project manager creates a plan (or blueprint) to guide the development process. They also track progress, communicate updates, and set deadlines for different stages of the project. Once the software is completed, they deliver it to the client and monitor its performance to make sure it works well over time.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software tool that helps programmers write, compile, and debug code. It includes features that make coding easier and faster, such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection. Examples include Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Why is an IDE important?
It knows the rules of programming languages and helps format code for better readability.
It suggests code completions and highlights mistakes while typing.
It compiles code into a format the computer can understand.
It allows automated testing before integrating with other code.
It provides debugging tools to step through the code and fix errors in real-time.
Version Control Systems (VCS)
A VCS helps teams track and manage changes to their code over time. A common example is Git.

Why is VCS important?
Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
Change Tracking – Keeps a history of all modifications for easy review.
Branching & Merging – Developers can work on new features separately and later merge them into the main code.
Error Recovery – If mistakes happen, previous versions can be restored easily.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Keeping Up with Technology – Technology evolves quickly, and engineers must constantly update their skills.
Solution: Continuous learning and Agile methods help them stay up to date.
Tight Deadlines – Software engineers work under pressure to meet strict deadlines.
Solution: Using Agile methods like Scrum helps manage workloads efficiently.
Limited Resources – Lack of advanced tools and efficient storage slows development.
Solution: Engineers need strong computing systems for better performance.
Changing Requirements – Software features often change, making development unpredictable.
Solution: Agile development and modular design create flexible and adaptable software.
Security Risks – Protecting software from hacking and cyber threats is challenging.
Solution: Engineers must research and apply strong security measures.
Difficult to Use Software – Complex software can confuse users.
Solution: Focus on simple, scalable, and reliable designs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual parts of the software, such as functions or modules, to ensure they work correctly on their own.
Integration Testing – Checks if different parts of the software work together smoothly, ensuring proper data flow and interaction.
System Testing – Examines the entire software to ensure it meets all performance, security, and usability requirements.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms whether the software meets business needs and is ready for users before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the technique of designing inputs that guide AI to generate accurate and relevant responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Why is it important?

Better User Experience – Helps users get accurate results quickly and reduces biases in AI responses.
More Flexibility – Allows prompts to be structured in a way that applies to different topics while maintaining logical clarity.
Greater Developer Control – Gives developers the ability to set clear instructions and context for AI interactions.
Example of Prompt Improvement:
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
Improved Prompt: "Give a brief summary of World War II, focusing on its causes and major events."
The improved prompt ensures AI generates relevant, high-quality responses tailored to the users' needs.
